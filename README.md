### Hi, I'm Furkan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior computer engineering student at Dokuz Eylul University. I'm usually working on backend development and I have a lot of experience in frontend development.

I completed an internship at ASELSAN which is one of Turkey's leading defense industry companies. During my internship at ASELSAN, I worked on a tool that enables the analysis of records on the serial data communication bus of military aircrafts.

After my internship at ASELSAN, I started working at Legaling. I worked on Django, jQuery, PostgreSQL and AWS technologies. 


I'm best reached via [email](mailto:furkankayar27@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
